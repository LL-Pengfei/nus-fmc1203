\question

After the recent CNY reunion dinner, Ah Kow took out a chocolate bar to share with his cute little nieces and nephews.  His chocolate bar consists of $x$ rows and $y$ columns of little chocolate squares, and (how convenient!) Ah Kow has $x \times y$ nieces and nephews in total!  Ah Kow wants to break the chocolate bar into the $1 \times 1$ chocolate squares and give each square to each of his nieces and nephews.

Each time, Ah Kow can only break a piece of chocolate either horizontally or vertically.

How many breaks does Ah Kow need to make?

\textbf{Black and White}
% Adapted from \url{http://www.cut-the-knot.org/SimpleGames/one_two.shtml}

In the game of Black and White, two players start with a random set of cards on the table.  The cards are either black or white in color.  Each player chooses a side (either black or white).  On each move a player selects two cards. These two are replaced with a single one according to the following rule:

\begin{quote}
Two cards of identical colors are replaced with a black card.  Two cards of a different colors are replaced with a white card.
\end{quote}

At the end of the game, when only one card remains, the player sided with the remaining color is the winner.

Is there a strategy that a player can use to win 100\% of the time?

\question
\textbf{Black, White, and Red}
Now consider a slightly different one-player game using cards of three different colors: black, white, and red.  On each move, the player must select two cards of a different colors.  These two are replaced with a single one of the remaining color.  (e.g., selecting a red card and a white card replaces these two cards with a black card).  

The goal of the game is to reach a state where all the cards are of the \textit{same} color.

Is it always possible?  What if we want to reach a state where all the cards are of a \textit{specified} color? (e.g., all black).

\question
\textbf{Knight on a Chessboard, II}

Two players $A$ and $B$ play a game on a empty chessboard with a knight piece. 
At the beginning, $A$ places the knight on any square, and $B$ moves the knight.
$A$ and $B$ then takes turn to move the knight, but they can only move it to a square that it has never been before.  The player who has no move left loses.

Is there a strategy that a player can use to always win the game?
